gets encrypted file offset from 0x2C (32 bit int)
gets amount of pgsr files from 0x28 (32 bit int)
autopool start offset 0x4C
0x70 has the start offset the of folder and file list
atlases has the images
the first of the file name headers offset at 0x38 (not encrypted, has sub files, has image sizes)
find group___AutoPool to get the last offset of autopool
0xC has the first pgsr offset
0x14 has the start of all of the subfiles/folders
0x50 has the offset of the offset of the auto pool
(0x85248 on my obb) after the dir list, a 32 bit int has the number of file names in the next area
0x44 has a differnt dir list
0x48 has the amount of files in the obb
0x58 has the end of the autopool thing
0x54 looks like it has a dif number of files
0x10 + 0x14 has a new area in the dir list

file names (maybe, not tested much)

it seems like the file order doesn't matter

next pgsr offset is at current pgsr offset + 40 + where the file data starts
file data offset offset is at 40 + start of the current pgsr header offset

the image size is at 0xF8 (248 and 252) (maybe wrong in other files)
spcutil needs the info file in rspg.dir for remaking the header

(in a rsgp/pgsr) 0x14 and 0x18 has one of the offset of the start of the zlib data

0x48 in packages.rsgp has the offset of the next pgsr header.
