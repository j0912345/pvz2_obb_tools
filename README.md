# Hello people viewing this in 2025. please read this section.    

This project was made for fun when I was learning python/programming in general. My actual pvz2 modding efforts used SPCUtil which is obsolete now as I'm writing but was commonly used at the time. SPCUtil back then and sen now have all of the functionality you need to mod the game, but this project doesn't. Feel free to still use this project if you want to for whatever reason of course, but you'll need to use extra additional tools to really mod the game.  
  
For people starting to mod the game now, I'd recommend just using sen on it's own. From what I know it should have all of the functionality you need, no extra tools required.

A few mod tools for pvz2.
You're probably best off looking at other places for pvz2 modding tools.  
See the [Plants vs. Zombies discord server](https://discord.gg/FBasnrE) (formerly called Floral Federation) for the most recent information, but, as I'm writing, look at sen or [pyvz2](https://github.com/Nineteendo/PVZ2tools/) for example.  
# what you need to run
1. python 3.10+ 
# what it can do so far  
1. unpack the obb  
2. extract all of the file names and save them into a json file
3. use a json file with those file names and add them back into the obb  
4. unpack most pgsr (aka rsgp) files
